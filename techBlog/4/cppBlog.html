<p class="blogContent"> 
	In this series of blog posts, I want to share few of my learning for my own reference while working on C++. 
	Topics could range from my understanding of the standard to C++ indioms such as Attorney-Client etc., to topics
	for which adequate documentation is not present or scarse.
