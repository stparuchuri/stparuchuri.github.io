<p class="blogTitle"> Phase of N phase shifted sinusoids <p>
<p class="blogContent"> 
	Last week while working through a problem, I came across 
	a unique behaviour while working with addition of tones 
	(these are not harmonics ) with different phase shift.</br></br>
	
	To give a brief description, I was adding tones 
	(exponential – so the signal had both in-phase and 
	quadrature phase components) – each with different phase 
	offset. The end goal was to find the change in angle/phase
	of product of summation of tones and a reference signal
	with respect to reference signal. </br></br>
	
	During the experiment, my observations showed that the net 
	angle/phase deviation from the original was the average of 
	the phase deviation of the tones being added. Puzzled by 
	the observations, I resorted to a quick MATLAB simulation 
	to confirm this. My MATLAB model’s results matched with my 
	observations. But I am still puzzled about the outcome. 
	I need to investigate this at some point as this seems to 
	be a quite interesting problem. </br></br>

	In this context, I found that in general the following 
	equation holds true:
	
	$$ tan^{-1}\lbrace\dfrac{sin \alpha_1 + sin \alpha_2 + \dots }
	{cos \alpha_1 + cos \alpha_2 + \dots }\rbrace = \dfrac{\sum_i \alpha_i}{n}$$

	I am trying to prove that the above equation holds up by parts. In this section, we try to prove that the above equation holds true for the case when $$ \alpha_i \ll 1 $$.</br></br>

	We know that, for $$ x \ll 1 \text{ i.e, very very small x, }  sin(x) \approx x $$. Similarly, for $$ x \ll 1 \text{ very very small x, } cos(x) \approx 1 $$. Thus, the numerator of 
	$$ tan^{-1}\lbrace\dfrac{sin \alpha_1 + sin \alpha_2 + \dots }{cos \alpha_1 + cos \alpha_2 + \dots }\rbrace = \dfrac{\sum_i \alpha_i}{n}$$ would get simplified to $$ \sum_{i}\alpha_i$$ and the denominator is simply 'n' when the series is a summation of 'n' terms. Thus the we have
	$$ tan^{-1}\lbrace\dfrac{sin \alpha_1 + sin \alpha_2 + \dots }{cos \alpha_1 + cos \alpha_2 + \dots }\rbrace = tan^{-1}\dfrac{\sum_i \alpha_i}{n}$$.
