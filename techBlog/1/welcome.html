Hi! After 3 full weekends of efforts, I am successful in creating
a custom blog for myself that renders LaTEX based mathematical 
equations. Primarily on this blog I want to share all interesting
things I come across in my preofessional and research career. In 
addition, I shall be able to share my opinions, all thanks to 
extra time freed from having to maintain my previous wordpress blog.

the famous Einstein's equation refer as a reference (see below). In
case if anyone is intersted to know, I am using American Mathematical
Society sponsored <a href="https://www.mathjax.org/"> MathJax </a> 
scripts through content delivery network.
