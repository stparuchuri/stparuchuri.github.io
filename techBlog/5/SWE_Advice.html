	In this series of blog posts, I shall document the mistakes I made
	while developing relatively large professional projects (both at a 
	for-profit corporate and open-source projects).

<p class="blogSection"> Premature optimization is the root of all evil </p>
<p class="blogContent">
	As the title of the section says and per Donald Knuth's advice, avoid
	code optimizations during initial stages of project. NOTE, I am talking
	about code/implementation optimizations, not design optimizations. 
	It is always best to have something working first and then expand on it
	or optimize it later on.
	
	Design/Architecture optimization on the other hand is required to be done
	before implementation, else it would result in massive refracting and 
	reorganizing of code. 
	
	As an example, if multiple components are required to be implemented, then don't
	try to seggregate members and member functions into public or private initially,
	but ave everything under public (except the obvious ones). Once the class works as
	expected, then worry about correct abstraction of class.

<p class="blogSection"> choose a preferred language for initial implementation </p>
<p class="blogContent">
	For initial implementation, always choose an easier language to implement over a 
	tougher one.

<p class="blogSection"> Don't be scared to change (existing) implementations </p>
<p class="blogContent">
	Don't be scared to change the already written code. This is more or less expected
	all the time. Version Control is your friend here.
