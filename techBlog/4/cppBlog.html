<p class="blogContent"> 
	In this series of blog posts, I want to share few of my learning for my own reference while working on C++. 
	Topics could range from my understanding of the standard to C++ indioms such as Attorney-Client etc., to topics
	for which adequate documentation is not present or scarse.

<p class="blogSection"> Setting Thread Affinity - to pin a thread to a CPU </p>
<p class="blogContent">
	Setting the affinity allows us to precisely define on which CPU does a process or thread run. </br>	
	
	Even though C++ standard defines the Threading library to create a thread, synchronize them etc, thus
	enforcing all compiler vendors to support namespace::std::thread's function, when we take a closer look,
	std::thread's functions are only a wrapper for the compiler vendor's APIs. In case of
	MSFT, Windows Threading API is just wrapped to the std::thread's functions defined in Spec, and in case 
	of linux, if pThread is the underlying API, then std::thread is just a wrapper for pThread's APIs. </br>
	
	On Windows, we must use MSFT's Windows API. This includes including following header files: "windows.h".
	Additionally, on Windows, one must enable process thread- since the thread affinity is allowed to be set to
	only those CPUs, on which process Affinity is set.
