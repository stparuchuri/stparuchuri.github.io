<p class="blogContent"> 
	In this series of blog posts, I want to share few of my learning for my own reference while working on C++. 
	Topics could range from my understanding of the standard to C++ indioms such as Attorney-Client etc., to topics
	for which adequate documentation is not present or scarse.

<p class="blogSection"> Setting Thread Affinity - to pin a thread to a CPU </p>
<p class="blogContent">
	Setting the affinity allows us to precisely define on which CPU does a process or thread run. </br>	
	
	Even though C++ standard defines the Threading library to create a thread, synchronize them etc, thus
	enforcing all compiler vendors to support namespace::std::thread's function, when we take a closer look,
	std::thread's functions are only a wrapper for the compiler vendor's APIs. In case of
	MSFT, Windows Threading API is just wrapped to the std::thread's functions defined in Spec, and in case 
	of linux, if pThread is the underlying API, then std::thread is just a wrapper for pThread's APIs. </br>
	
	On Windows, we must use MSFT's Windows API. This includes including following header files: "windows.h".
	Additionally, on Windows, one must enable process thread- since the thread affinity is allowed to be set to
	only those CPUs, on which process Affinity is set.

<p class="blogSection"> sizeof(struct) != structure's real memory footprint </p>
<p class="blogContent">

	It is important to note that sizeof() returns the actual size to which the compiler compiles the given structure definition which
	need <b> NOT</b> be the same as the sum of sizes of all elements's data types. This is because the compiles aligns the fields by padding
	dummy bytes as programs cannot access a single byte if used inside a structure on any processor which fetches more tha a single byte at time
	from memory. And as you guessed, this alignment is compiler specific.
	
	<b> Example:</b> If the structure is defined, stored and used only in memory, then it wouldn't raise any issues since, all compiler definitions
	are the same - have the padding information, while it be reading from memory or writing to memory etc. But this is especailly gets grose, when 
	strucures definitions operate across different mediums. Such as writer (any program) writes data of strucute to a file on a byte by byte basis, and
	a reader uses the same header file definition of structure writer used (but compiles on a different compiler) on a function that reads the data 
	fromthe file. Since the writer and reader compilers are different, there could be a case when the compiler's padding might not match between reader and 
	writer's compilerf for same structure definition even if using same header file in both the casses.
	
	The issue of struct's size arising due to compiler's alignment effort by padding the structure can be excluded in a blanket way by setting the compiler flag
	to use 1 byte (or what ever in your case) as the default alignment. The other approach is to set it on a per variable/declaration basis in code 
	using compilers directives  or alignas keyword. <b> NOTE: </b> alignas can only be used to increase the alignment and not decares from compiler's 
	default values, whereas #pragmas {#pargma pack() // in case of MSFT c++ compiler} can be used to decrease as well.
